## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

In progress: Just another world

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A pixelated rpg game, guiding the character back to his world.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software that I'm using will make the game function witht he code inputted. It will have a battle and choice features which could lead to good or bad choices. It will be executed with hopefully different character having different reponses to the main character action in game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish designing the world and at least have some storyline in the game to make it playable.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would have at least the opening scene of the game and some dialogue to accompany it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to add the choice base sequence to the game and making the battle scene and other minigame to make it more fun. I am also going to add some visual novel in here if possible.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills I need to acquire is understanding how to use my programming software and learn what to start with first. Some topics I need to research are some story idea and how the visual novel are going to work.
